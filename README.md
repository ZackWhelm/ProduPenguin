**idea stuffs** <br>
<li> i miss club penguin.</li>
<li>i also like the trend of cozy idle games that live on your browser.</li>
<li>i think it'd be cool to spin one of them into a productivity widget.</li>
<li>bongo cat's input counter feels nice, i think there are some game abstractions that could live on a desktop for productivity. </li>


<br> **dev stuffs** <br>
<li> a basic draggable image within transparent window. ✅ </li>
<li> a pomodoro style timer that causes the image to flash blue after timer goes off.✅</li>
<li>a timer with animated text that appears above the image representing phase of pomodoro.✅</li>

 <br> **observations** <br>
seeing the mining counter go up is decently satsifying, i think an anim of a penguin mining glaciers will be even more satsifying.
